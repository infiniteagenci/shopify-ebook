# Marketing Attribution in a Privacy‑First World

I remember staring at my Google Analytics after iOS14 hit. My Facebook ads looked like they were working brilliantly—but my revenue told a different story. I was pouring money into a channel that seemed to convert, yet my bank account said otherwise. I felt betrayed by the data. That’s when I learned: last‑click attribution is a story we tell ourselves, not the truth.

This chapter is about seeing through that illusion. We’ll set up tracking that actually works in 2025, measure what matters, and stop guessing where your money is best spent.

> **Founder’s Confession**  
> I cut all top‑of‑funnel spend because “last‑click said it didn’t convert.” Six months later I discovered those channels were fueling my email list. I nearly bankrupted my business by trusting a broken model.

## 1. The Attribution Crisis

### What Changed with iOS14+

Apple forced users to opt‑in to tracking. Only about 20% say yes. That means 80% of your iOS traffic is a black box. Facebook can’t see the full journey. Last‑click gives all credit to the last ad clicked—ignoring the five awareness ads that came before.

**Result:** Social looks terrible in GA, but removing it kills your funnel.

### Cookie Deprecation

Safari’s ITP blocks third‑party cookies after a day. Chrome is following. UTMs still work if you capture them immediately and store them server‑side. Otherwise, the data vanishes.

### Impact

- Panic: “Marketing is broken”
- Mis‑budgeting: Over‑invest in retargeting, under‑invest in brand
- Bad decisions: Killing channels that actually drive profit

> **Take a Breath**  
> The game didn’t change—it just got honest. If you relied on last‑click, you were already flying blind. Now everyone has to use better methods. That’s good.
