# Research Notes: Customer Service & Support Systems for Shopify

## Why It Matters
- 73% of customers say friendly customer service influences purchasing decisions
- 42% of customers expect a response within 60 minutes (Forbes)
- Good service = higher retention, lower refunds, more positive reviews
- Poor service = public negative reviews, brand damage, lost LTV

## Core Support Channels

### 1. Email
- Still the most common support channel for e-commerce
- Expected response time: < 24 hours (ideally < 12)
- Use Shopify's native email notifications for order status
- Enhanced with help desk app for ticketing, templates, automation

### 2. Live Chat
- High conversion impact: answers pre-purchase questions instantly
- Response time: < 5 minutes ideally
- Outside business hours: chatbot or offline form
- Integrates with messengers (Messenger, WhatsApp)

### 3. Phone
- Critical for high-value products or B2B
- Business hours only
- Consider using a virtual number (e.g., Google Voice, RingCentral)

### 4. Social Media (Messenger, Instagram, Twitter)
- Public-facing; quality of responses impacts brand perception
- Expected response: < 1 hour for many users
- Use unified inbox to manage all channels in one place

### 5. Self-Service (FAQ, Help Center)
- 67% of customers prefer self-service over contacting support (Microsoft)
- Reduces ticket volume and operational costs
- Must be easy to find, searchable, and up-to-date

## Essential Support Apps

### Help Desk / Ticketing
- **Gorgias** – All-in-one unified inbox; integrates with Shopify data; automation rules; popular for scaling
- **Zendesk** – Mature platform; robust features; pricier; good for large teams
- **Help Scout** – Simpler, more affordable; good for small teams
- **Tidio** – Live chat + ticketing + chatbots; free plan available

### Knowledge Base / FAQ
- Many help desks include this (Gorgias, Zendesk)
- **Easy DIY** – Build using Shopify pages and a searchable theme section
- **Hero** – Standalone help center with AI search (paid)

### Order Tracking & Notifications
- Shopify's built-in notifications (order confirmed, shipped, delivered)
- **Tracktor** – Advanced tracking with carrier integration and customer portal
- **AfterShip** – Popular tracking solution; branded tracking page

### Returns & Exchanges
- **Returnly** – Self-service returns portal; exchange first, return later
- **Loop Returns** – Advanced returns with exchanges, refunds, store credit
- Shopify native returns (basic)

## Support Workflow Best Practices

### Tiered Support
- Tier 1: FAQs, simple questions (automated or junior staff)
- Tier 2: Order issues, product questions (experienced staff)
- Tier 3: Technical issues, escalations (specialist or developer)

### Automation & Macros
- Create saved replies for common questions (shipping times, sizing, returns)
- Use rules to auto-tag and route tickets
- Set up chatbots for triage (collect email, order number, issue type)

### Context is Key
- Support agents should see:
  - Customer order history
  - Past support interactions
  - Current cart/checkout status (if applicable)
- Gorgias and Zendesk pull this from Shopify automatically

### Proactive Support
- Notify customers of delays before they ask
- Follow up on delivered orders to ensure satisfaction
- Reach out to abandoners (cart recovery is a separate flow)

## Metrics to Track

- **First Response Time** – How long until a human replies?
- **Resolution Time** – How long to close the ticket?
- **Satisfaction Score (CSAT)** – Rate after each interaction
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** – Overall brand loyalty
- **Ticket Volume by Category** – Identify common issues to fix root cause
- **Self-Service Rate** – % of visitors who find answers without contacting

## Scaling Support

- Start with owner handling all support (direct contact)
- As volume grows, hire 1-2 support agents (train on brand voice, products)
- At ~50 tickets/day, consider a dedicated help desk and team lead
- Use automation aggressively to keep headcount low

## Tools Stack Recommendation by Stage

### Bootstrapped (< $100k revenue)
- Help desk: Tidio (free tier) or Gorgias Essentials ($19/mo)
- FAQ: Shopify page with simple search
- Returns: Manual process or Shopify native
- Live chat: Built into help desk

### Growing ($100k–$1M revenue)
- Help desk: Gorgias Standard ($99/mo) or Zendesk Support ($49/agent)

### Enterprise ($1M+ revenue)
- Help desk: Zendesk Suite or Gorgias Pro (+$299/mo)
- AI chatbot: Integration with Intercom or custom
- Advanced analytics: Custom dashboards

## Security & Privacy

- Never ask for passwords or full credit card numbers via chat/email
- Use Shopify's "customer note" field for internal context, not sensitive data
- Comply with GDPR: store support data securely, allow deletion requests
- Train staff on data handling and PCI compliance

## Case Study: From Inbox to Unified Platform

A D2C brand with $500k revenue used Gmail for support. Challenges:
- No ticket tracking
- Multiple team members responding to same emails
- No visibility into order context
- Manual copy-pasting of tracking numbers

They implemented Gorgias:
- All channels (email, Messenger, Instagram) in one place
- Shopify order data embedded in each ticket
- Macros reduced response time from 30 min to 5 min
- Automated tags and rules for triage
- Result: 40% reduction in resolution time, CSAT increased from 82% to 94%
