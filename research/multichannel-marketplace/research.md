# Research Notes: Multichannel & Marketplace Selling for Shopify

## Why Go Multichannel?
- Expand reach beyond your owned store
- Meet customers where they already shop (Amazon, Instagram, Google)
- Diversify revenue streams; reduce dependence on single channel
- Increase brand visibility and trust

## Core Channels

### Google Shopping / Merchant Center
- List products in Google Shopping tab and Search (free listings)
- Paid Shopping ads for higher placement
- Integration via Shopify Google & Instagram app
- Requires product feed optimization (GTINs, titles, images)

### Amazon
- Massive audience but competitive and fee-heavy
- Use integration apps (Codisto, Sellbrite, ChannelIntegration) to sync inventory/orders
- Maintain separate pricing strategy (Amazon prices often lower)
- Fulfillment: FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) vs FBM (Fulfillment by Merchant)

### eBay
- Good for certain verticals (collectibles, electronics)
- Fixed-price listings; auction format less common now
- Integration apps similar to Amazon

### Walmart Marketplace
- Growing marketplace, lower competition than Amazon
- Requires application and approval
- Good for general merchandise

### Social Commerce
- **Instagram Shopping**: Tag products in posts/stories; checkout via Instagram (US only) or link to Shopify
- **Facebook Shops**: Native storefront on Facebook; syncs with Shopify
- **TikTok Shopping**: Product links in videos; integration via Shopify apps
- **Pinterest**: Buyable pins; Product Pins

### Other Marketplaces
- Etsy (handmade, vintage)
- Newegg (electronics)
- Wayfair (home goods)
- Target Plus (invitation-only)

## Shopify Tools for Multichannel

### Shopify Channels
Shopify has a **Channels** section in admin where you can add and manage each marketplace/social channel. Many have native integrations; others require apps.

### Inventory Sync
- Centralized inventory in Shopify; changes propagate to connected channels
- Avoid overselling; set buffer stock if needed
- Apps handle conflict resolution (manual review for discrepancies)

### Order Management
- Orders from all channels flow into Shopify admin
- Fulfill from Shopify; tracking updates sync back to marketplace
- Single customer view if same email used across channels

## Strategy & Best Practices

### Choose Channels Wisely
- Start with 1-2 additional channels; don't spread too thin
- Pick channels where your target audience shops
- Consider your product category fit (e.g., fashion on Instagram, electronics on Amazon)

### Optimize Listings Per Channel
- Each marketplace has its own SEO (keywords, titles, descriptions)
- Use channel-specific templates; don't just copy Shopify product page
- High-quality images required (different specs per channel)
- Pricing: some channels require MAP pricing or include their own fees

### Fulfillment
- Use Shopify's shipping tools or third-party (ShipStation, Shippo)
- For Amazon FBA, app handles inventory and order handoff
- Ensure carriers and tracking are reliable

### Advertising on Channels
- Once listed, you can run ads on the platform (Amazon Sponsored Products, Google Shopping ads, Instagram product ads)
- Budget allocation based on ROAS

## Common Challenges

- **Inventory sync errors** leading to overselling
- **Channel fees** cutting into margins (Amazon ~15%, eBay ~10-12%, etc.)
- **Brand inconsistency** across channels (different images, descriptions)
- **Customer service** across channels (customers may contact via marketplace instead of you)
- **Tax compliance** in different states/countries

## Legal & Policy
- Each marketplace has its own terms, performance standards, and penalties
- Amazon strict on product authenticity and customer service metrics
- Google Merchant Center requires data quality; suspensions common

## Apps to Simplify
- **Codisto** – Multi-channel listing (Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Google, etc.) with sync
- **Sellbrite** (by GoDaddy) – Channel management
- **ChannelIntegration** – Another popular multi-channel sync
- **Shopify Google & Instagram** app – Native integration for Google Shopping, Instagram Shopping, Facebook Shops

## Metrics for Multichannel
- Sales by channel
- Fulfillment cost per channel
- Return rate by channel
- Customer acquisition cost by channel (including fees)
- Channel-specific conversion rate

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Audit your product catalog** – ensure accurate data (GTINs, dimensions, weight)
2. **Choose 1-2 starter channels** – based on audience and product fit
3. **Install integration app** (or use native Shopify channel)
4. **Map product data** to channel requirements (categories, attributes)
5. **Set pricing** (consider channel fees; maintain MAP if needed)
6. **Sync inventory** initially; test with a few products
7. **Launch** – monitor orders, sync errors, customer inquiries
8. **Iterate** – optimize listings based on performance
